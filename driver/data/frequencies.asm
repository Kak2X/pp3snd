; =============== Sound_FreqDataTbl ===============
; Table with pairs of base frequency values for the frequency/NRx3-NRx4 registers.
; Essentially these are "musical notes" ordered from lowest to highest.
; This data may not be necessarily used as-is, an offset could be applied to the value read from here.
